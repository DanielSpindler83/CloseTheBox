# Close The Box aka Shut The Box

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_the_box  

I play with the 10 tile\lever variation.  

Player rolls two dice.  

Firstly both numbers are added(if total is 11 or 12 then this step is skipped), if the total tile\lever number is up then it is shut\closed\put down.  

If the total tile\lever is already down, then we check both of the single digit number tiles\levers, if either are up then we put them down.  

The player continues until all the numbers are down: the box has been closed\shut, or more likely, the player has a turn where they can not put a title\lever down.  

The numbers left "up" are then added together to form the player's total. The lower the number the better.  

Often a player has one full game as above and then another player has one full game, totals are recorded for 5 games each, a grand total is calculated and the player with the lowest number wins.   
If a player closes\shuts the box they auto win the full 5 rounds immediately(no further games played and total ignored).

This app runs a single player game a specified amount of times and displays the precentage of times a close the box win occurs.

This confirms that closing the box occurs approx 3.34 % of games.
